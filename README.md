# Junior-Proyekt
*<h2>Summary</h2>*
In its core, this project is basically a game.

Though true, the point of the project is different. When released, all source will be completely available via Github (here!) for users to download and thus play and experiment with a full-blown game's code and see the structure, as well as the planning involved *(GDD, TDD, pitches and concept write-ups will all be available thru a link at the very end)*.
