# Junior-Proyekt
##*Summary*
In its core, this project is basically a game.

Though true, the point of the project is different. When released, all source will be completely available via Github (here!) for users to download and thus play and experiment with a full-blown game's code and see the structure, as well as the planning involved *(GDD, TDD, pitches and concept write-ups will all be available thru a link at the very end)*.

##*Getting this thing to work*
The whole contents of the repository is one whole Eclipse Java project named *"Junior-Proyekt"*. Please do not think I am Russian just because of my use of *Proyekt*.

But, just download the stuff into a folder named *"Junior-Proyekt"*, and use Eclipse Java to create a new project with *"Junior-Proyekt"*'s contents within. K?

##*Time Schedule*
As far as when this project will be finished, that would be mid-June to early-July at the latest.

As for the approximated schedule:

######*January to mid-February*
- The time for planning!
- Get a good, solid idea of what the *focus* of the game is
- Get a huge list of concepts revolving around that *focus*, even if they seem stupid

######*Second half of February*
- 'Tis the season for weeding out!
- Look thru all the ideas of what concepts there should be
- Find the golden nuggets
  - Then hash them out; give attention to what the concept is supposed to do
  - After hashing out, implement them into the game
    - This should be enough to have a rough demo for the player

######*March*
- Gotta give the player something to *play* with... enemies!
- Looking at the player and its concepts, conceive ideas of what an enemy would do for this certain player
  - Hash out those enemies and its interaction with the player
    - And also how the player will interact back
- These are all the enemies and bosses of the game

######*April*
- The month of level design!
- Pretty much, come up with level designs and get them onto paper and code!
- These are not final levels, so any idea would do
- Things to keep in mind:
  - How high the player can jump
  - Distance the player needs to walk around
  - How high of a ceiling is needed

######*May*
- Creation of level design with story!
- With the creation of the story and the level designs made in April, surely the great designs made before will be able to transfer into the story
- On top of that, here will be where timing, clipping, and meshes become involved
- Once the product is done, code freeze will happen
  - In code freeze, everything is cleaned up, including comments made
  - Also, testing will be done at this point in time; perhaps even during the whole project if people want to

######*June*
- Final testing, clean up, and release!
- Well, it has been released since the beginning, so there's basically no difference
