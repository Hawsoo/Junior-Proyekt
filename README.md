# Junior-Proyekt
*<h2>Summary</h2>*
In its core, this project is basically a game.

Though true, the point of the project is different. When released, all source will be completely available via Github (here!) for users to download and thus try out and play with a full-blown game and see the structure, as well as the planning involved *(GDD, TDD, pitches and concept write-ups will all be available thru a link at the very end)*.
